# SwiftAutomation README

## About

SwiftAutomation is an Apple event bridge that allows Apple's Swift language 
to control "AppleScriptable" macOS applications directly. For example:

  // tell application "iTunes" to play
  try ITunes().play()

  // tell application "Finder" to set fileNames to name of every file of home
  let fileNames = try Finder().home.files.name.get() as [String]


  // tell application "TextEdit" to make new document Â¬
  //                                     with properties {text:"Hello World!"}
  try TextEdit().make(new: TED.document, 
                      withProperties: [TED.text: "Hello World!"])


The SwiftAutomation framework defines the basic functionality for constructing
object specifiers, converting data between Swift and AE types, and sending 
Apple events to running applications. Generated Swift files supply the glue
code for controlling individual applications using human-readable terminology.

SwiftAutomation's goal is to provide better than 99.9% compatibility across the 
wide range of real-world "AppleScriptable" macOS applications available today.
Unlike macOS's ORM-style ScriptingBridge, which is crippled by numerous broken/
missing features and application incompatibilities, SwiftAutomation's design
is based on the appscript (http://appscript.sourceforge.net) library's proven
RPC + query-builder architecture, tailored to Swift's syntax and type system.


## Status

SwiftAutomation is alpha status: it is sufficiently complete to allow testing 
and experimentation, but some functionality is missing/incomplete/buggy. A 
rough draft of the SwiftAutomation documentation is included. Expect errors 
and omissions, use at own risk, etc.


## Get it

To clone the Xcode project to your own machine:

  git clone https://bitbucket.org/hhas/swiftae.git

The project includes a `SwiftAutomation.framework` target for embedded use. 

To run simple examples (see test/main.swift), build and run the `test` target.

An experimental playground with pre-generated glue files for TextEdit, Finder,
and iTunes is included in the project, and may be used with care (see below).

Additional glues can be generated by building the `aeglue` target and running
the resulting `aeglue` command line tool in Terminal. For example, to generate
a Swift glue and accompanying documentation for macOS's Photos application:

  /path/to/aeglue -o ~/Desktop Photos

A basic translation tool, AppleScriptToSwift, that converts application commands
from AppleScript to Swift syntax is also included. To use it, build and run the 
AppleScriptToSwift target. Type an AppleScript command into the top text pane
and click the Run button to view the equivalent Swift syntax in the bottom pane.
(If the 'Send Apple events' checkbox is selected, the command is also sent to
the target application and its result displayed too.)

Note that `aeglue` and AppleScriptToSwift.app normally retrieve application 
terminology using `ascrgdte` ('get dynamic terminology') Apple events. Some 
applications (e.g. Finder) have faulty `ascrgdte` handlers that fail to return
correct terminology, in which case use the `-s` or 'Use SDEF terminology' 
options instead. (Be aware that SDEF-based terminology may also contain bugs 
and omissions, in which case use raw four-char codes or correct generated glue 
code by hand.)

SwiftAutomation requires macOS 10.11 and Swift 3.0 and Xcode 8.0 or later.


## Known issues

When using SwiftAutomation within an interactive playground, be aware that Xcode
automatically re-runs ALL code within a playground whenever a line of code is
modified, causing ALL application commands to be re-sent. This is not a problem
when using non-mutating application commands such as `get` and `count`; however,
take care when using commands that modify the application's state - `make`,
`move`, `delete`, etc. - within a playground as sending these more than once may
have unintended/undesirable results. This is a playground issue that affects ALL
non-idempotent and/or unsafe function calls, not just application commands.


## Etc.

No warranty given, E&OE, use at own risk, etc.
