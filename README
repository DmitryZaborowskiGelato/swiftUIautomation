# SwiftAE README

## About

SwiftAE provides client-side Apple event bindings for Apple's Swift language,
enabling it to control "AppleScriptable" OS X applications directly.

For example:

  tell application "TextEdit" to get text of document 1

  let result = try TextEdit().documents[1].text.get() as! String


## Status

SwiftAE is an in-progress port/rewrite of the AppleEventBridge framework's
prototype Swift-AE support (https://bitbucket.org/hhas/appleeventbridge).
SwiftAE's objective is to provide the Swift language with first-class
application scripting support, equal in capability and compatibility to
AppleScript, efficiently integrated with Swift's static type system.

The Specifier classes are more or less complete, though due to bugs and
vagaries of swiftc, these classes cannot be used directly but only as
part of a generated glue; a default AEApplicationGlue is included for
convenience. Apple event dispatch works, though has yet to be fully tested,
and bugs may still exist in both.

Type bridging is far from complete, and various issues have yet to be
resolved, particularly coercion and casting. Arrays and Dictionaries
currently cannot be used in application commands, and command methods
always return Any (specializing return types via generics is proving
tricky to implement reliably).

Documentation is not yet included; for now, see the documentation for the
prototype Swift-AE bridge in the AppleEventBridge project.


## Get it

To clone the SwiftAE Xcode project to your own machine:

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/hhas/swiftae.git

The project is currently configured to build a CLI executable for test
purposes only. (Support for building an embeddable SwiftAE framework
will be added once the code is complete.)

For convenience, glue files for TextEdit, Finder, and iTunes are included
in the project. Additional glues can be generated using the `aeglue` tool
in the SwiftAE project folder, e.g.:

    cd SwiftAE
    ./aeglue Photos.app SwiftAE

The `aeglue` tool currently requires the AppleEventBridge framework to
generate additional application glue files. To clone the AppleEventBridge
project to your own machine:

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/hhas/appleeventbridge.git

The AppleEventBridge.framework should be built and installed in:

    ~/Library/Frameworks

SwiftAE requires OS X 10.11 and Swift 2.0 and Xcode 7 GM or later.
