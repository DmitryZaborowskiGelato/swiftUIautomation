# SwiftAE README

## About

SwiftAE provides client-side Apple event bindings for Apple's Swift language,
enabling it to control "AppleScriptable" OS X applications directly.

For example:

  tell application "TextEdit" to get text of document 1

  let result = try TextEdit().documents[1].text.get() as! String


## Status

SwiftAE is an in-progress port/rewrite of the AppleEventBridge framework's
prototype Swift-AE support (https://bitbucket.org/hhas/appleeventbridge).
SwiftAE's objective is to provide the Swift language with first-class
application scripting support, equal in capability and compatibility to
AppleScript, efficiently integrated with Swift's static type system.

The Specifier classes are more or less complete, though due to bugs and
vagaries of swiftc, these classes cannot be used directly but only as
part of a generated glue; a default AEApplicationGlue is included for
convenience. Apple event dispatch works, though has yet to be fully tested,
and bugs may still exist in both.

Type bridging is far from complete, and various issues have yet to be
resolved, particularly coercion and casting. Arrays and Dictionaries
currently cannot be used in application commands, and command methods
always return Any (specializing return types via generics is proving
tricky to implement reliably).

A rough draft of the SwiftAE documentation (ported from AppleEventBridge)
is included. Expect errors, omissions, etc.

## Get it

To clone the SwiftAE Xcode project to your own machine:

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/hhas/swiftae.git

The project's SwiftAE target is currently configured to build a CLI
executable for testing (see test/main.swift). Building an embeddable
SwiftAE framework will be added once it's ready for general use. Building
a standalone SwiftAE framework will also be supported once Swift itself
supports this.

For convenience, glue files for TextEdit, Finder, and iTunes are included
in the project. Additional glues can be generated by building the `aeglue`
target and running the resulting `aeglue` command line tool in Terminal.
For example, to generate a SwiftAE glue and documentation for Photos.app:

    /path/to/aeglue Photos ~/Desktop

SwiftAE requires OS X 10.11 and Swift 2.0 and Xcode 7 GM or later.
